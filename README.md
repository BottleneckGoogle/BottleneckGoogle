## Hi there 👋
Bypass Limitations Imposed by Google on the Performance of Google Pixel 📱⚡

1. Processor Speed Limitation in Battery Saver Mode 🔋  
   Google Pixel may throttle the processor speed when the device enters battery saver mode to extend battery life, which can lower performance when running resource-intensive apps.

2. RAM Usage Limitation for Background Apps 💾  
   Google Pixel has limitations on the amount of RAM that can be used by background apps, ensuring the main apps run smoothly, but this can cause background apps to stop or reload.

3. Charging Speed Limitation ⚡  
   Google Pixel applies limitations to the charging speed to protect the battery, meaning charging may be slower compared to other devices that support fast charging without restrictions.

4. Hardware Updates Limited Through Software Updates 🔄  
   Google often limits hardware upgrades through software updates, meaning major performance boosts may only be available through new model releases rather than software updates for older models.

5. Limitation of Access to Experimental Features 🔬  
   Some features, like performance settings or system modifications, are restricted to more experienced users, leading to limitations in access for most users.

6. Bloatware and Pre-installed App Limitations 📦  
   Google Pixel comes with a set of pre-installed apps (bloatware) that cannot be fully uninstalled by users, which may burden the device's performance.

7. Limitation on Custom Kernel Usage in Some Versions 🛠️  
   Certain Google Pixel versions may restrict the use of custom kernels or require complex rooting procedures, which can impact the stability and performance of the device.

8. Limitation of AI Features Accessible Manually 🤖  
   AI-based features like battery optimization or AI-based performance settings are often restricted in default settings, meaning users can't directly access manual configurations to adjust device performance.

9. Limitation on Device Use by Certain Apps 📱🔒  
   Google may limit the use of specific device features, such as the camera or image processing, by third-party apps that do not have full permissions, affecting the performance of those apps.

10. System Update Frequency Limitation on Older Models 📅  
   Google provides more frequent system and security updates for newer devices, while older models may receive updates less frequently, which can impact overall performance over time.

These limitations are typically implemented to maintain system stability, extend the device's lifespan, and ensure an optimal user experience, although they can sometimes restrict certain functions and performance on Google Pixel devices. 🔧📈
